# Getting And Cleaning Data
## Course Project
This repository contains my work for the Course Project in Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course within the Data Science Specialization.

## Files

```run_analysis.R``` - This is the only R script in the project. It may be executed with no parameters, and it will download the raw data archive, unzip it, and perform the transformations required by the project. 

```output.txt``` - This is the tidy data produced as an objective of this project.
