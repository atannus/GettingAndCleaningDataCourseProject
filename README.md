# Getting And Cleaning Data
## Course Project
This repository contains my work for the Course Project in Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course within the Data Science Specialization.

## Files

```run_analysis.R``` - This is the only R script in the project. It may be executed with no parameters (by sourcing it either from CLI or RStudio), and it will download the raw data archive, unzip it, perform transformations required by the project and output a tidy data file.

```output.txt``` - This is the tidy data produced as an objective of this project.
